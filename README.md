# HQ Trivia Acebot

HQ Trivia Acebot uses a total of 1 search method to find the most likely answer for HQ Trivia questions.
It is run on a powerful server with gigabit internet speeds, meaning it can process much more data and information that a standard pc, increasing the number of correct answers, however this bot can't promise all correct answers due to HQ always striving to make HQ as hard as possible to bot or search answers, by making 'decoy' questions, obvious to humans, but that are able to trick a bot. 


Curently supporting these HQ games:
-
-> UK (@2PM + 8PM UTC, as well as all 'suprise' games)

-> (US NOT YET SUPPORTED)

(7PM + 1AM UTC, as well as all 'suprise' games)



# How To Use

Step 1
-
Navigate to https://repl.it/repls/MediumblueRightCron in a browser window on your computer (phones work, but are too small)

Step 2
-
Click the button that says 'run', with the play button

Step 3
-
When prompted for the password for the server (in the terminal on the right side of the screen), input the password that was given by me when you payed, and press the enter button on your keyboard.

Step 4
-
The bot should now be running :) yay! Just now keep the browser window open, when a new question gets detected, the bot will try and find an answer, and then it will be displayed on the screen, in the terminal.

FAQ
-
Q: As the client is made in python, can i just copy the code and run it from my computer directly in my python environment

A: Of course! The reason why the client is on repl.it is so people don't have to install a python environment, and can run the bot from ANYWHERE, but if you want to run it on your computer directly, feel free, but make sure to use python 3.x, as the client isn't compatible with python 2



# Pricing

Currently, until all the bugs have been completely ironed out, and the answer searcher is as accurate as possible, the bot will be completely FREE. 

While the bot is free, use the password 'test' (without quote marks, all lowercase) to gain access to the bot. Once the bot gets made paid, it will change weekly.

Â£1 / week = 12 Games per week (24 if you compete in both the UK and US games), not even including all the 'suprise' games with massive jackpots.
-
The price of access of the bot will (hopefully) decrease over time, as more people become intrested, as the money only needs to cover the running server costs (expensive!), and recoup the costs of the server during development. This bot is created for the greater good, not profit.


Accepted forms of payment:

-> BTC, BCH, ETH or any other reasonably large cryptocurrency.

# Guarantee

In the unlikely event that the bot goes down for any reason, i would be more than happy to reinburse the cost for the duration bot over the time the bot goes down and/or extend the access time for the bot by the duration of the bot downtime.
