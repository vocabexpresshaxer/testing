# HQ Trivia Acebot

HQ Trivia Acebot uses a total of 1 search method to find the most likely answer for HQ Trivia questions.
It is run on a powerful server with gigabit internet speeds,meaning it can process much more data and information that a standard pc, increasing the number of correct answers, however this bot can't promise all correct answers due to HQ always striving to make HQ as hard as possible to bot or search answers, by making 'decoy' questions, obvious to humans, but that are able to trick a bot. 


Curently supporting these HQ games:
-
-> UK (@2PM + 8PM UTC, as well as all 'suprise' games)

-> (US NOT YET SUPPORTED)

(7PM + 1AM UTC, as well as all 'suprise' games)



# How To Use

# Pricing

Currently, until all the bugs have been completely ironed out, and the answer searcher is as accurate as possible, the bot will be completely FREE. While the bot is free, use the code 'test' (without quote marks, all lowercase) to gain access to the bot. Once the bot gets made paid, it will change weekly.

The price will be Â£1 weekly (Less than a price of a coffee), which is 5x2 games (weekdays) and 2x1 games (weekends) = 12 Games, not including all the 'suprise' games with massive jackpots.

The price of access of the bot will (hopefully) decrease over time, as more people become intrested, as the money only needs to cover the running server costs (expensive!), and recoup the costs of the server during development.


Accepted forms of payment:
-
-> BTC, BCH, ETH or any other reasonably large cryptocurrency.

-> Paypal

-> Amazon.co.uk gift cards


# Guarantee

In the unlikely event that the bot goes down for any reason, i would be more than happy to reinburse the cost for the duration bot over the time the bot goes down and/or extend the access time for the bot by the duration of the bot downtime.
